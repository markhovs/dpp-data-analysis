Countermark.com,Countermark,"Overview
Countermark is a printed data carrier that works like a QR code but it can be printed using printers already in use in almost all production lines running today. This will radically reduce adoption costs and allow many organisations to experiment with digitally signing products straight away.

Plain or Encrypted

Countermark can be plain text â like a QR code that anyone can create, or encrypted, meaning that Countermarks can be used in value chains where counterfeiting is an established risk. Only verified companies can create encrypted Countermarks â this is a strong powerful barrier to Counterfeiting

Use of existing printers and ink

Everybody is aware of the dot printed characters on almost every food product. Normally âbest byâ dates and batch codes. Countermark uses these same printers and inks and uses two rows of characters to create a human readable digital data carrier that can be read by phone App or by eye.

Multilingual

Countermark is currently supported in 4 fonts, more can be added, the four fonts are
â¢ Latin (USA, Western Europe, Oceania) 
â¢ Cyrillic (Eastern Europe including Greece, Ukraine and Russia)
â¢ Simplified Chinese (China and Taiwan)
â¢ Katakana (Japan)
Example fonts can be found here

https://countermark.com/blog/countermark-a-different-type-of-data-carrier-for-different-language-types

Much lower capital cost that QR codes

A production line speed printer for QR codes can cost approx. Euro 400,000, the printers needed for Countermark cost about Euro 7,000, almost all manufacturers already have this type of printer in use.

Direct Integration into ERP

The top row of the human readable Countermark can be included on invoices and delivery notes, linking traceability information to financial records, meaning a company can be audited for materials long after goods have been sold.

Supporting companies consist mainly on current users from different branches (like Schaeffler, Metro, Stadler, SBB, C&A, ...), different EPCIS supporting initiatives (like R-Cycle, GS1 Rail, GSTS initiative, ...), different public funded projects (like IoF2020, Circ4Life, IntelliPack, COPPA, ...), legal requirements (diverse EU directives, German LKSG, ...) and focussing most on one of these branches (electro/industry, textile, battery, food, packacking). The USP results from the fact that each member profits from each others development, data, experiences while using the same standards, technologies and data flow.

Fashion For Biodiversity,FFBS ID,"Introduction: FFBS-ID is a hybrid (NFC+RFID) digital product passport for the fashion and lifestyle industry, where the journey of fashion items from farm to fashion, including their impact on environment & biodiversity, can be visualised using geospatial data.

Goal: Our goal is to create a digital product passport that meets the requirements of the Green Claims Directive and the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF). The initial requirement is to remove human intervention in data entry at T5 (origin of raw materials) and to prepare its environmental assessment without any external influence.

Benefit: Our DPP is a good solution for fashion brands looking for proof-based traceability and to be prepared for any current or future due diligence or supply chain legislation or directives such as PEF, EUDR, EU Biodiversity Strategy, CSRD-(ESRS E4) etc.

USP: Use of triangular-auditing (space, IoT and drones) to prove the origin of raw materials (T5).

Covers the whole supply chain.

Compliance with environmental and biodiversity standards. 

Suitable for reselling and garment sorting centers.

Can be used as a customer acquisition tool (futuristic retail experience) using VR and audio-visual from the supply chain.

On-cell Battery Passport State of Health Chip,Dukosi Cell Monitor,"The Dukosi Cell Monitor integrated circuit (chip) provides 24/7 State of Health (SOH) exposure data about battery cells, for inclusion with Battery Passport data. Users can scan the BMS, or, in the case that modules or cells are no longer associated with the vehicle or BMS, the cells and modules themselves can be scanned to directly provide cell-level State of Health exposure data. 

Select data from the Battery Pass longlist, cell manufacturing data, and usage history data is stored on each cell or parallel cell group for an on-cell record of lifetime exposure.  This data stays with each cell or parallel cell group, even when the cells or modules are removed from a battery pack, while also providing battery management system (BMS) cell monitoring and balancing functionality for first and second life battery packs.  Benefits are realized throughout cell manufacturing, pack assembly, first and second life battery pack use, and recycling.  Additional benefits include augmenting cloud data gaps and providing lifetime cell exposure data for State of Health (SOH) assessment.  Access to battery health data is critical for optimal battery lifecycle management, enhancing safety and efficiency for repair, refurbishment, repurposing, and recycling.  The Cell Monitor can also be configured to accommodate additional data required by the Battery Regulation for access by the Public, Interested Persons, and the Commission.

Pentalym Surfboard Digital Product Passport,Unknown,"Australia's coastal identity is intricately linked with surfing, a sport celebrated worldwide and deeply ingrained in Australian culture. With millions actively participating and countless more immersed in the surfing lifestyle, Australia's extensive coastline, consistent waves, and vibrant surf communities have solidified its global reputation as a premier surfing destination.

Pentalym, headquartered in Kiama, a south coast town surrounded by surf breaks, aims to integrate surfboards with digital product passports for real-time traceability and comprehensive information. This innovative approach enables the monitoring of every aspect of a surfboard's lifecycle, from production to delivery, with options for sustainable product reuse. Customers have the ability to review surfboard information via a Pentalym embed smartCode which includes product information, returns, warranty and how to return for repurposing/sustainability to reduce the number of surfboards going into landfill.

Pentalym's Digital Product Passport as a Service (DPPaaS) offers a complete solution that aligns with the European Commission's Circular Economy Action Plan. As an associate member of the CIRPASS consortium, Pentalym is uniquely positioned to assist brands in adopting digital solutions, with experience in tracking millions of items across the supply chain.

Pentalym's digital solutions, including RFID technology, are already embraced by various industries and can enhance product management and customer experiences. By implementing DPPaaS, brands can showcase their commitment to sustainability and engage customers through transparency and product lifecycle insights. The future promises to provide valuable insights for preemptive actions, waste reduction, and sustainability enhancements. Early planning and DPPaaS adoption are vital for companies facing digital transformations to ensure compliance, sustainability, and product longevity in a dynamic market.

Surfboards Digital Passport,SDPaaS,"Australia's coastal identity is intricately linked with surfing, a sport celebrated worldwide and deeply ingrained in Australian culture. With millions actively participating and countless more immersed in the surfing lifestyle, Australia's extensive coastline, consistent waves, and vibrant surf communities have solidified its global reputation as a premier surfing destination.

Pentalym, headquartered in Kiama, a south coast town surrounded by surf breaks, aims to integrate surfboards with digital product passports for real-time traceability and comprehensive information. This innovative approach enables the monitoring of every aspect of a surfboard's lifecycle, from production to delivery, with options for sustainable product reuse. Customers have the ability to review surfboard information via a Pentalym embed smartCode which includes product information, returns, warranty and how to return for repurposing/sustainability to reduce the number of surfboards going into landfill.

Pentalym's Digital Product Passport as a Service (DPPaaS) offers a complete solution that aligns with the European Commission's Circular Economy Action Plan. As an associate member of the CIRPASS consortium, Pentalym is uniquely positioned to assist brands in adopting digital solutions, with experience in tracking millions of items across the supply chain.

Pentalym's digital solutions, including RFID technology, are already embraced by various industries and can enhance product management and customer experiences. By implementing DPPaaS, brands can showcase their commitment to sustainability and engage customers through transparency and product lifecycle insights. The future promises to provide valuable insights for preemptive actions, waste reduction, and sustainability enhancements. Early planning and DPPaaS adoption are vital for companies facing digital transformations to ensure compliance, sustainability, and product longevity in a dynamic market.

"tex.tracer, supported by Fujitsu",tex.tracer ,"
This solution is a new supply chain transparency platform called tex.tracer, which currently gives brand owners the insights they need to act upon and with the click of a button report to all stakeholders. By scanning a QR code on a garment with their mobile, consumers can also trace the garmentâs history. This solution allows consumers to make educated decisions, whereby ethical and environmental issues are taken into account. In essence, tex.tracer provides end-to-end traceability of the supply chain and ESG. Therefore, everyone has access to their own data and the ability to exclude unwanted parties from accessing this data.

tex.tracer utilizes Blockchain technology to provide a public electronic ledger that can be openly shared among disparate users to create an unchangeable record of transactions with each entry time-stamped and linked to the next one. The solution was develop with the support of Fujitsu. . Fujitsu now has an ongoing managed service agreement for the platform and will support future developments.

Trackit Traceability Program,Trackit,"Trackit is a technology agnostic traceability program developed based on a set of open materials, processes and products standards that is widely adopted in the textile sector, to trace certified fiber and raw materials across the textile supply chain from source to product. It is currently used to trace materials certified to Textile Exchange standards, and standards that leverages Textile Exchange chain of custody standard (Content Claim Standard).

Textile Exchange chain of custody standard ensures that every stage of the supply chain is third party verified. This involves an on-site audit, a document review, and then the awarding of a scope certificate. Each time products moving along the supply chain are shipped, the certification body also issues transaction certificates, from the seller to the buyer. 

Trackit currently has two traceability pathways, Digital Trackit (dTrackit) and Electronic Trackit (eTrackit). dTrackit centralizes and connects scope and transaction certification data stored by certification bodies, while eTrackit takes it one step further by tracking the volume of certified material via online tokens, or eTransactions, issued per kilogram of material.

All chain of custody data is securely stored and governed centrally by Textile Exchange (a U.S. based 501(c)(3) not for profit with a mission to accelerate and scale global fiber and materials production that positively impacts our planet) as a single source of truth for traceable certified materials. Certified brands are given access to their scope

Trackit is operational across 30+ certification bodies and 60,000+ sites globally for certified materials in organic, recycled, responsible wool, alpaca, mohair and down. Partnerships are in place to extend this service for producer-level schemes to trace certified materials from source to product, and there is potential for site-level schemes to connect facility certifications to existing chains. As the source of truth for certified materials across six key categories in the textile sector, discussions are also underway with technology solution providers to validate the certified materials and/or facilities in their system.

Trackit is delivered as part of Textile Exchangeâs Shared Measurement System (SMS) - an open technology platform developed to centralize and standardize data on material sustainability so that we can track the textile sectorâs progress towards our Climate+ goals. It integrates the data that we process, connects, and reconciles information in the textile value chain, and links it with other data networks to achieve a data ecosystem of shared measure. 

As part of our effort to realize a sector wide shared measure, we are also working with our partners and community of experts to:
-	Extend the materials, processes and products standards to apply across all material categories
-	Develop tiering standard for the textile supply chain across all material categories
-	Develop sustainability program standard for the textile supply chain  
-	Develop impact measure standards for the textile sector
-	Develop a Life Cycle Inventory library to connect impact data to material production
